<br>A simple perl script to inject runes in the lol client<br>
**How it works**
<br>Makes lol API requests to determine selected champion for the user then do some rune page actions
<br>
**How to use**
<br>
*update.pl is self explanatory (it gets the latest runes.json and version.txt)*
<br>
*aram.pl, injector.pl, runemap.json, runes-sr.json, habyss.json, version.txt must be in the same dir* 
<br>
1.open lol client and login into your account<br>
2.check hide preset pages (prevent current rune errors)<br>
3.keep at least 1 custom rune page and delete all others <br>
4.run injector.pl after confirming the champion at selection or aram.pl after joining the lobby / changing champion<br>
**Debug**
<br>If it doesn't work try running via cmd so you can see perl output<br>
**Any question?**
<br>--no, it's not bannable, does the same shit as blitz, porofessor <br>
**Special thanks**
